<h2>HIP RESURFACING</h2>

  <div="img">
    <center><img src="https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/CTOYuFbjO.cVOnG4rnHJDg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpdDtoPTI2MDtxPTgwO3c9MzMy/https://s.yimg.com/zb/imgv1/723cc3c4-23d6-3029-927e-c5458b9f3329/t_500x300" width="300" height="300"></center>
</div>
<p>Hip resurfacing has been developed as a surgical alternative to total hip replacement (THR). The procedure consists of placing a cap (usually made of cobalt chrome metal), which is hollow and shaped like a mushroom, over the head of the femur while a matching metal cup (similar to what is used with a THR) is placed in the acetabulum (pelvis socket), replacing the articulating surfaces of the person's hip joint and removing very little bone compared to a THR. When the person moves the hip, the movement of the joint induces synovial fluid to flow between the hard metal bearing surfaces lubricating them when the components are placed in the correct position. The surgeon's level of experience with hip resurfacing is most important; therefore, the selection of the right surgeon is crucial for a successful outcome. Health-related quality of life measures are markedly improved and the person's satisfaction is favorable after hip resurfacing arthroplasty.
</p>  
<h2>Uses<h2> 
  <p>A person's suitability for hip resurfacing is decided by the person's anatomy and the surgeon. Hip resurfacing is generally more suitable for younger people who are not morbidly obese, are clinically qualified for a hip replacement (determined by the doctor), have been diagnosed with noninflammatory degenerative joint disease, do not have an infection, and are not allergic to the metals used in the implant.
    The potential advantages of hip resurfacing compared to THR include less bone removal (bone preservation), a reduced chance of hip dislocation due to a relatively larger femoral head size (given that the person has an anatomically correct femoral head size), and easier revision surgery for any subsequent revision to a THR device because a surgeon will have more original bone stock available. Hip resurfacing has the potential of being a solution for life, allows a normal ROM (range of movement) and minimizes the amount of "stress shielding", compared with THR. Since the femoral neck is retained and the femoral cavity with its marrow not opened up two other advantages exist, namely no risk of blood clots by fatty marrow that can enter the blood stream with the THR procedure and no risk of introducing bacteria in the opened femoral canal resulting in a deep infection as can happen with the THR procedure. The potential disadvantages of hip resurfacing are femoral neck fractures (rate of 0–4%), aseptic loosening, and metal wear. Due to the retention of the person's complete femoral neck other advantages exist: Surgeon induced discrepancies in leg length (as could happen with THR) are now minimized. Also, the toe-in or toe-out faults that could occur interoperatively with THR are now over because the femoral neck that determines foot direction is left undisturbed with hip resurfacing.
   
     </p>
 <h2>CONTRA-INDICATIONS</h2>
  <p>Hip resurfacing should not be used on people who have severe bone loss in their femoral head, those with large femoral neck cysts present (typically found at surgery) or cysts that are close to the head neck junction, or people who have poor bone stock or osteoporosis. Caution should be used for people who have rheumatoid arthritis, are tall, thin, or small boned,] those with osteonecrosis (poor blood supply) to the femoral head, or those with femoral head cysts > 1 cm on an x-ray taken before surgery. 
    Metal-on-metal resurfacing systems are generally unsuitable for women of child-bearing age due to unknown effects of metal ion release on the fetus. There are hip resurfacing components that have a ceramic coating on metal femoral head component and cross linked polyethylene plastic as a liner for the socket or cup area making it not metal on metal. The plastic sleeve can be replaced if needed without removing the main components.
    </P>
    <h2>TECHNIQUE</h2>
    <p>The hip resurfacing devices are metal-on-metal articulating devices which differ from total hip replacement devices because they are more bone conserving and retain the natural geometry (so-called large ball THR devices share this trait). A THR requires that the upper portion of the femur bone be cut off to accept the stem portion of a THR device. The femur cap of the hip resurfacing devices does not require the femur bone be cut off; instead the top of the femoral head is shaped to closely fit the underside of the cap. Both hip resurfacing and hip replacement require that a cup is placed in the acetabulum of the hip socket. The main advantage of the hip resurfacing surgery is that when a revision is required, there is still an intact femur bone left for a THR stem. When a THR stem requires a revision, the metal stem in the femur has to be removed and often more bone is lost in the process of removal and replacement with a larger diameter stem. Having a hip resurfacing at a younger age means that a revision will likely be easier to perform when required. 
      Recent studies have shown that the outcome of a hip resurfacing is dependent on surgeon experience and that proper positioning of hip resurfacing components is crucial. Therefore, in addition to ensuring that a proven device is used, care should be taken in selecting a surgeon with experience and a good track record. 
     
      
     
      </p>
      <h2>HIP REPLACEMENT<h2>
        <p>Hip replacement is a surgical procedure in which the hip joint is replaced by a prosthetic implant, that is, a hip prosthesis. Hip replacement surgery can be performed as a total replacement or a hemi (half) replacement. Such joint replacement orthopaedic surgery is generally conducted to relieve arthritis pain or in some hip fractures. A total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty or THA) consists of replacing both the acetabulum and the femoral head while hemiarthroplasty generally only replaces the femoral head. Hip replacement is one of the most common orthopaedic operations, though patient satisfaction varies widely. Approximately 58% of total hip replacements are estimated to last 25 years. The average cost of a total hip replacement in 2012 was $40,364 in the United States, and about $7,700 to $12,000 in most European countries

          Medical uses
          Total hip replacement is most commonly used to treat joint failure caused by osteoarthritis. Other indications include rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis, traumatic arthritis, protrusio acetabuli, certain hip fractures, benign and malignant bone tumors, arthritis associated with Paget's disease, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as physical therapy and pain medications, have failed. 
          </p>

        </div> 
        <p>Dislocation (the ball coming out of the socket) is the most common complication. The most common causes vary by the duration since the surgery. 
          Hip prosthesis dislocation mostly occurs in the first three months after insertion, mainly because of incomplete scar formation and relaxed soft tissues. It takes eight to twelve weeks for the soft tissues injured or cut during surgery to heal. The chance of this is diminished if less tissue is cut, if the cut tissue is repaired and if large diameter head balls are used.
          Dislocations occurring between three months and five years after insertion usually occur due to malposition of the components, or dysfunction of nearby muscles. 
          Surgeons who perform more operations tend to have fewer dislocations. An anterior approach seems to lower dislocation rates when small diameter heads are used, but that benefit has not been shown when compared to modern posterior incisions with the use of larger diameter heads. The use of larger diameter head size in itself decreases dislocation risk, even though this correlation is only found in head sizes up to 28 mm: larger heads do not result in a statistically significant decrease in dislocation rate.[8] Keeping the leg out of certain positions during the first few months after surgery further reduces risk. 
          
        </p>   
        <h2>Vein thrombosis</h2>
        <p>Venous thrombosis such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are relatively common following hip replacement surgery. Standard treatment with anticoagulants is for 7–10 days; however, treatment for 21+ days may be superior. Extended-duration anticoagulants (up to 35 days following surgery) may prevent VTE in people undergoing hip replacement surgery. Other research suggested that anticoagulants in otherwise healthy patients undergoing a so-called fast track protocol with hospital stays under five days, might only be necessary while in the hospital. Emerging evidence supports the use of aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. 
          Some physicians and patients may consider having an ultrasonography for deep vein thrombosis after hip replacement.[25] However, this kind of screening should only be done when indicated because to perform it routinely would be unnecessary health care. 
          Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices are sometimes used for prevention of blood clots following total hip replacement. 
        </p>
        <h2>Osteolysis</h2>
        <p>Many long-term problems with hip replacements are the result of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that wear off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. Ceramic bearing surfaces may eliminate the generation of wear particles. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication.</p>                 
        <div="img">
        
            <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Hip_prosthesis_zones_by_DeLee_and_Charnley_system%2C_and_Gruen_system.jpg/1024px-Hip_prosthesis_zones_by_DeLee_and_Charnley_system%2C_and_Gruen_system.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
      </div> 
        <p>Hip prosthesis zones according to DeLee and Charnley, and Gruen. These are used to describe the location of for example areas of loosening.
          On radiography, it is normal to see thin radiolucent areas of less than 2 mm around hip prosthesis components, or between a cement mantle and bone. These may indicate loosening of the prosthesis if they are new or changing, while areas greater than 2 mm may be harmless if they are stable. The most important prognostic factors of cemented cups are absence of radiolucent lines in DeLee and Charnley zone I, as well as adequate cement mantle thickness. In the first year after insertion of uncemented femoral stems, it is normal to have mild subsidence (less than 10 mm). The direct anterior approach has been shown to itself be a risk factor for early femoral component loosening.</p> 
          
          <h2>Metal sensitivity</h2>
          <p>Concerns were raised in the early 2000s regarding metal sensitivity and the potential dangers of metal particulate debris from hip prostheses, including the development of pseudotumors, soft tissue masses containing necrotic tissue, around the hip joint. It appears these masses were more common in women, and these patients showed a higher level of iron in the blood. The cause was then unknown, and was probably multifactorial. There may have been a toxic reaction to an excess of particulate metal wear debris or a hypersensitivity reaction to a "normal" amount of metal debris. 
            Metal hypersensitivity is a well-established phenomenon and is not uncommon, affecting about 10–15% of the population.[36] Skin contact with certain metals can cause immune reactions such as hives, eczema, redness and itching. Although little is known about the short- and long-term pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of circulating metal degradation products in vivo, there have been many reports of immunologic-type responses temporally associated with implantation of metal components. Individual case reports link immune hypersensitivity reactions with adverse performance of metallic cardiovascular, orthopedic and plastic surgical and dental implants
            </p>
          <h2>Metal toxicity</h2>
          <p>Most hip replacements consist of cobalt and chromium alloys, or titanium. Stainless steel is no longer used. Any metal implant releases its constituent ions into the blood. Typically, these are excreted in the urine, but in certain individuals the ions can accumulate in the body. In implants which involve metal-on-metal contact, microscopic fragments of cobalt and chromium can be absorbed into the person's bloodstream. There are reports of cobalt toxicity with hip replacement, particularly metal-on-metal hip replacements, which are no longer in use. 
            Use of metal-on-metal hip replacements from the 1970s was discontinued in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly after the discovery of aseptic lymphocyte-dominant vasculitis-associated lesions (ALVAL). However, the FDA's 510k approval process allowed companies to have new and "improved" metal-on-metal hips approved without much clinical testing. Some people with these prostheses experienced similar reactions to the metal debris as occurred in the 20th century; some devices were recalled. 
            </p>
          <h2>Hemiarthroplasty</h2>
          <div="img">
        
            <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Femoral_offset_in_hemiarthroplasty_%28crop%29.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
      </div>
          <p>Femoral (neck) offset is defined as the perpendicular distance between the intramedullary or longitudinal axis of the femur and the center of rotation of the native or prosthetic femoral head. An offset of less than 33 mm is associated with hip dislocation. 
            Hemiarthroplasty is a surgical procedure that replaces one half of the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part unchanged. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after an intracapsular fracture of the femur neck (hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or composite prosthesis. The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore and Thompson prostheses. A composite of metal and HDPE that forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) can be used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to offer any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly/frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level. This is because over time the prosthesis tends to loosen or to erode the acetabulum. Independently mobile older adults with hip fractures may benefit from a total hip replacement instead of hemiarthroplasty.
