    <h2>KNEE REPLACEMENT</h2>

      </div> 
<p>Knee replacement, also known as knee arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure to replace the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee joint to relieve pain and disability, most commonly offered when joint pain is not diminished by conservative sources[1][2] and also for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. In patients with severe deformity from advanced rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, or long-standing osteoarthritis, the surgery may be more complicated and carry higher risk. Osteoporosis does not typically cause knee pain, deformity, or inflammation and is not a reason to perform knee replacement.
    Other major causes of debilitating pain include meniscus tears, cartilage defects, and ligament tears. Debilitating pain from osteoarthritis is much more common in the elderly.
    Knee replacement surgery can be performed as a partial or a total knee replacement.[3] In general, the surgery consists of replacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the knee with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the knee.
    </p>

<h2>Pre-operative preparation</h2>

</div> 
<p>To indicate knee replacement in case of osteoarthritis, its radiographic classification and severity of symptoms both should be substantial. Such radiography should consist of weightbearing X-rays of both knees: AP, lateral, and 30 degrees of flexion. AP and lateral views may not show joint space narrowing, but the 30-degree flexion view is most sensitive for narrowing. Full-length projections also are used in order to adjust the prosthesis to provide a neutral angle for the distal lower extremity. Two angles used for this purpose are:
    •	Hip-knee-shaft angle (HKS), an angle formed between a line through the longitudinal axis of the femoral shaft and its mechanical axis, which is a line from the center of the femoral head to the intercondylar notch of the distal femur. 
    •	Hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the ankle joint. It is normally between 1.0° and 1.5° of varus in adults. 
    The patient is to perform range-of-motion exercises, and hip, knee and ankle strengthening as directed daily. Exercises that include strengthening of hip flexors, hip abductors and knee flexors helps to recover faster post operatively.[13] Before the surgery is performed, pre-operative tests are done: usually a complete blood count, electrolytes, APTT and PT to measure blood clotting, chest X-rays, ECG, and blood cross-matching for possible transfusion. About a month before the surgery, the patient may be prescribed supplemental iron to boost the hemoglobin in their blood system. 
    Preoperative education is currently an important part of patient care. There is some evidence that it may slightly reduce anxiety before knee-replacement surgery, with low risk of detrimental effects. 
    Knee replacement referrals are often blocked if a person is overweight because it is believed they may benefit less from surgery. However, knee replacements have been found to reduce pain and improve function, regardless of people's weight. After 10 years, most people did not need repeat surgery. In addition, weight loss surgery before a knee replacement does not appear to change outcomes.

  <h2>Femoral replacement</h2>
    <div="img">

<p>A round-ended implant is used for the femur, mimicking the natural shape of the joint. On the tibia the component is flat, although it sometimes has a stem that goes down inside the bone for further stability. A flattened or slightly dished high-density polyethylene surface is then inserted onto the tibial component so the weight is transferred metal to plastic, not metal to metal. During the operation any deformities must be corrected, and the ligaments balanced so the knee has a good range of movement, and is stable and aligned. In some cases the articular surface of the patella also is removed and replaced by a polyethylene button cemented to the posterior surface of the patella. In other cases, the patella is replaced unaltered.

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been an increase in technology assistance with implantation of total knee replacements. Traditionally, knee replacements were performed using mechanical jigs, not unlike those used in carpentry. These mechanical jigs rely on vision and human judgment. Using computer assistance to provide navigation, navigated knee replacements provide assistance in more accurate placement of implanted knee replacements based on mechanical axis. While these implants are placed more accurately, there has not been much improvement in long-term outcomes. Similarly, sensor-based guidance provides accurate feedback to demonstrate soft-tissue tension to assist in guidance of insertion of knee replacements. Robotic-assisted knee replacements take into account both mechanical axis and soft-tissue balancing in order to assist the surgeon in placement of a knee replacement. Short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted knee replacements are promising. </p>

<h2>Post-operative pain control</h2>

<p>The regional analgesia techniques (neuraxial anesthesia or continuous femoral nerve block or adductor canal block) are used most commonly. Local anesthesia infiltration in the pericapsular area using liposomal bupivacaine provides good analgesia in the post-operative period without increasing the risk for instability or nerve injury. A combined approach of local infiltration analgesia and femoral nerve block to achieve multimodal analgesia is common. </p>
<h2>Modified intervastus approach</h2>

<p>Introduced in 2018, a modified intervastus approach to the anterior knee may be used for total knee arthroplasty.The procedure is intended to preserve the quadriceps tendon and vastus medialis. </p>
<h2>Tourniquet use</h2>
<p>The current body of evidence suggests if a tourniquet is used in knee replacement surgery, it probably increases the risk of severe side effects and postoperative pain.The evidence did not show any clear benefit on patient function, treatment success or quality of life. </p>
<h2>Controversies</h2>
<p>The femoral, tibial and patellar components of a total knee replacement are fixed to the bone by using either cement or cementless total knee replacement implants. Cemented fixation is performed on the vast majority of total knee replacements. However, short-term trials suggest that there may be relief of pain. There are concerns regarding tibial loosening after implantation, prohibiting widespread adoption of cementless knee replacements at this time. </p>
<h2>Denervation of the patella</h2>
<p>There is debate regarding denervating the patella. Anterior knee pain is thought to be related to the association of the patella and femoral component. Some surgeons believe that by using electrocautery to denervate the patella, it reduces the chance of anterior knee pain postoperatively. </p>
<h2>Patella resurfacing</h2>
<p>Many surgeons in the USA perform patella resurfacing routinely, while many surgeons in Asia and Europe do not. Patella resurfacing is performed by removing the cartilage from the surface of the knee and replacing it with polyethylene. Surgeons who do not routinely resurface the patella do not believe that it is a significant contribution to pain, when there is no evidence of arthritis to the patellofemoral joint. Some surgeons believe it is not cost-effective routinely to resurface the kneecap and that routine patella resurfacing may lead to increased complications such as patella fracture. Other surgeons are concerned that patients with an unresurfaced patella may have increased pain postoperatively. A meta-analysis evaluating outcomes following patella resurfacing found that routine resurfacing more reliably relieves patient's pain.</p>
<h2>Tibia polyethylene component</h2>
<p>Polyethylene is the plastic component that is inserted between the femoral and tibial components. There are several different polyethylene component designs that have been published, including posterior stabilized (PS), cruciate retaining (CR), bicruciate retaining (BCR), medial congruent (MC) and mobile bearing. </p>
<h2>Ligament retaining or sacrificing</h2>
<p>The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is important to the stability of the knee by preventing posterior subluxation of the tibia, reducing shear stress, increasing flexion and lever arm of the extensor mechanism by inducing femoral rollback upon flexion, and thus minimizing polyethylene abrasion through reducing stress applied to the articular surface. The PS implant uses a post that is built into the implant to accommodate for the loss of PCL. Proponents of retaining the PCL advise that it is difficult to balance a CR knee and unnatural physiologic loads may increase wear of the polyethylene. Multiple studies have demonstrated minimal to no difference between the two designs. </p>
<h2>Medial congruent polyethylene and ligament retaining</h2>
<p>MC knee replacements attempt to mimic a more natural knee motion by decreasing motion on the medial aspect of the knee and allowing for increased motion on the lateral aspect of the joint. This mimics the external rotation and abduction of the tibia that is seen during normal ambulation. While several studies have shown improved gait profiles, long-term studies are needed to demonstrate improved results. Conversely, the BCR knee retains the Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments to try to mimic the normal tension of the knee's ligaments. Concerns over increased revision frequency have led to some designs being pulled from the market. </p>
<h2>Mobile bearing</h2>
<p>A mobile bearing design allows for free motion of the polyethylene within the tibial component. Other component designs have the polyethylene member fixed to the tibial component, and only articulate at the femur/polyethylene junction.[40] There is no strong evidence that this approach improves knee function, mortality, adverse events, or amount of pain, compared with a fixed bearing approach for total knee replacement. Mobile bearing designs are important to ensuring decreased wear rates in hinged knee arthroplasty. </p>
<h2>Minimally invasive</h2>
<p>Minimally invasive procedures have been developed in total knee replacement that do not cut the quadriceps tendon. There are different definitions of minimally invasive knee surgery, which may include a shorter incision length, retraction of the patella without eversion (rotating out), and specialized instruments. There are few randomized trials, with studies finding less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and shorter recovery times. These studies studies have not shown long-term benefits. </p>
<h2>Partial knee replacement</h2>
<div="img">
    <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Knee_prosthesis_components.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
</div>
    <p>Unicompartmental arthroplasty (UKA), also called partial knee replacement, is an option for some people. The knee is generally divided into three "compartments": medial, lateral, and patellofemoral. Most people with arthritis severe enough to consider knee replacement have significant wear in two or more of the above compartments, and are treated with total knee replacement (TKA). A minority of people with osteoarthritis have wear primarily in one compartment, usually the medial, and may be candidates for unicompartmental knee replacement. Advantages of UKA compared to TKA include smaller incision, easier post-op rehabilitation, better postoperative range of motion, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, lower risk of infection, stiffness, and blood clots, but a harder revision if necessary. Persons with infectious or inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis), or marked deformity are not candidates for this procedure. 
    Many studies demonstrate higher revision rates associated with partial knee replacements. There is significant variation in revision rates, depending on implant design and implantation technique.
